This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

# React Native Boilerplate

This is a react native boilerplate for Android which brings pre-configurations such as:

- Folder structure.
- Alias path instead of using long paths.
- Use of custom fonts.
- Image cache.
- Svg image support.
- Environment variables for react native.
- Splash screen.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> It's necessary to create a new file **.env** in the root for try it out environment variables

> [!TIP] 
> If you add variables to your **.env** file, remember to add its type to `environment.d.ts` to keep type safety

# Scripts

```bash
# Starts Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.
yarn start

# Runs in develop mode for android
yarn android

# Runs in develop mode for android
yarn ios

# It cleans android building
yarn clean

# It builds an apk file in release mode.
# APK file can be found at android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
yarn build:apk

# It builds a bundle file in release mode. This file is the one required by google play
# Bundle file can be found at android\app\build\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab
yarn build:bundle
```

<!-- ### Upgrade app version

```cmd
npm run upgradeVersion
# or
yarn upgradeVersion
``` -->

## Splash screen settings

To custom the splash screen **image** you can change the the file in the root folder named: `logo.png` you can can change it by a `PNG` or a `SVG` file

Then to generate the images for each platform run:

```bash
yarn react-native generate-bootsplash --logo-width 150 ./logo.png
```
